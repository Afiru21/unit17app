# Unit 17 Mobile app development 
## Brief 
After finishing the design documenttation for the mobile app I created the program for the mobile app prototype. since its only a  prototype  the looks do not exactly meet my initial  plan but it is expected that the key functionality it presents. Therefore my  mobile app should be able to do the following:

- Keep track of the amount of water someone has had in a day (User input)
- Be able to track the number of workouts in whichever way you feel would work
- Have some sort of timer that can be used to time workouts
- Has multiple screens OR One other creative function that would be suitable for a wellness gym / spa ( This is where I can show your creativity here)
